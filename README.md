## üß† Memory System: The Brain Behind the AI

Our Kaggle Problem Solver comes equipped with a sophisticated memory system that acts as the brain of our AI, allowing it to learn, adapt, and make informed decisions throughout the problem-solving process. Here's how it works:

### Memory Components

1. **Short-Term Memory**:

   - Stores recent interactions and important information
   - Uses a weighted system to prioritize crucial data
   - Helps maintain context during the problem-solving process

2. **Long-Term Memory**:

   - Utilizes Chroma, a vector database, for efficient storage and retrieval
   - Stores documents, code snippets, and execution results
   - Enables semantic search for relevant information

3. **Examples Memory**:
   - Stores successful task executions (task, code, result)
   - Used for few-shot learning and providing relevant examples

### Key Features and Usage

#### 1. Dynamic Summarization

The memory agent continuously updates a summary of the project's progress:

```python
updated_summary = memory_agent.update_summary(task, code, result)
```

#### 2. Contextual Question Answering

Combines short-term and long-term memory for informed responses:

```python
answer = memory_agent.ask("What are the key points of the challenge?")
```

#### 3. Semantic Search

Finds relevant information based on meaning, not just keywords:

```python
relevant_docs = memory_agent.search_documents("AI advancements", doc_type="tech_report")
```

#### 4. Few-Shot Learning

Retrieves similar examples to guide new task executions:

```python
few_shot_examples = memory_agent.get_few_shots(task, n=4)
```

#### 5. Document Management

Adds and retrieves documents with metadata:

```python
doc_id = memory_agent.add_document("Document content", "doc_type", {"metadata": "value"})
document = memory_agent.load_document(doc_id)
```

#### 6. Short-Term Memory Management

Adds important information to short-term memory with priority:

```python
memory_agent.add_to_short_term_memory("Important info", importance=1.5)
```

### Usage in Key Components

#### Code Generation Agent

```python
# Retrieve relevant examples
few_shot_examples = memory_agent.get_few_shots(current_task, n=4)

# Access documentation
relevant_docs = memory_agent.search_documents(query, doc_type="documentation")

# Maintain context
memory_agent.add_to_short_term_memory(f"Generated code: {code}", importance=1.5)

# Add executed task to examples
memory_agent.add_example(task, code, result)
```

#### Planner

```python
# Initialize document retrieval
memory_agent.init_doc_retrieve()

# Access challenge information
challenge_info = memory_agent.ask(f"What are the key points of the {challenge_name} challenge?")
```

#### Task Enhancer

```python
# Retrieve relevant context
relevant_context = memory_agent.ask_docs(current_task)

# Add enhanced task to memory
memory_agent.add_to_short_term_memory(str(enhanced_task))
```

By leveraging this powerful memory system across all components, our Kaggle Problem Solver becomes more than just a code generator ‚Äì it's a learning, adapting, and evolving AI partner in your machine learning journey!
