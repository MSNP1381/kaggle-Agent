# Kaggle Agent Progress Report

## Executive Summary

The Kaggle Agent project aims to develop an autonomous system capable of solving various Kaggle challenges, including tabular machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision tasks. Our agent utilizes a "plan and execute" model with significant enhancements, particularly the introduction of an Enhancer module. Current progress shows stable working code generation, with ongoing developments in planning and execution capabilities.

## 1. Introduction

The Kaggle Agent is an ambitious project designed to automate the process of tackling diverse data science challenges on the Kaggle platform. By leveraging advanced AI techniques and a modular architecture, this goal is to create a system that can autonomously analyze problems, develop solutions, and generate high-quality code to solve these challenges.

## 2. Project Overview

this project is based on the "plan and execute" agent model, with significant improvements tailored for Kaggle challenges. The core of innovation lies in the Enhancer module, which refines tasks within the plan to optimize results. While the Replanner module is still under development, the Enhancer has shown promising performance in generating stable, working code.

## 3. System Architecture

The Kaggle Agent consists of seven key modules, each playing a crucial role in the problem-solving process:

1. **Scraper**: Extracts and summarizes challenge information from Kaggle.
2. **Data Utils**: Analyzes datasets, providing quantitative and qualitative insights.
3. **Planner**: Develops step-by-step solutions based on challenge data and requirements.
4. **Enhancer**: Refines plan tasks using previous data and execution results.
5. **Replanner**: (In development) Will adjust plans based on feedback.
6. **Code Generation Agent**: Produces code for implementing solutions.
7. **Executor**: Runs code via Jupyter server API and processes results.

## 4. Detailed Module Descriptions

### 4.1 Scraper

The Scraper module is responsible for extracting crucial information from Kaggle challenges. It focuses on three key aspects:

1. Challenge information
2. Evaluation criteria
3. Data description

Each aspect is processed through separate LLM calls to summarize and extract relevant information, providing a comprehensive overview of the challenge.

### 4.2 Data Utils

This module performs in-depth data analysis, including:

- Univariate analysis
- Data visualization
- Statistical summaries

It works in conjunction with the challenge's data description to provide a thorough understanding of the dataset.

### 4.3 Planner

Utilizing information from the Scraper and Data Utils, the Planner creates a detailed, step-by-step plan for solving the challenge. It outlines specific goals and strategies tailored to the challenge requirements.

### 4.4 Enhancer

The Enhancer is a key innovation in our system, designed to refine and optimize tasks within the solution plan. It functions as an AI assistant specializing in task enhancement for Kaggle machine learning problems. Key features include:

- Summarizes previous code and tasks to maintain consistency in the ML notebook
- Interprets results from previous executions to inform current enhancements
- Structures enhanced tasks for optimal understanding by the Code Generation Agent
- Considers the full project context, including problem description, dataset info, and evaluation metrics
- Identifies specific requirements for each task to achieve the best results
- Uses a systematic thought process: Task → Thought → Actions → Observation → Final Answer

The Enhancer's output is a refined, context-aware task description that serves as optimized input for the Code Generation Agent, ensuring each step in the solution process is tailored to the specific Kaggle challenge.

### 4.5 Replanner

Currently under development, the Re-planner will:

- Analyze feedback from executed steps
- Adjust the overall plan as needed
- Ensure adaptability to changing circumstances or unexpected results

### 4.6 Code Generation Agent

Based on recent research in AI-driven code generation, this agent:

- Produces code implementing the enhanced plan
- Ensures code quality and adherence to best practices
- Adapts to specific requirements of each Kaggle challenge

### 4.7 Executor

The Executor module:

- Interfaces with a Jupyter server via API
- Runs generated code in a controlled environment
- Collects and processes results through websocket communication
- Provides feedback for plan refinement and code improvement

## 5. Current Progress and Achievements

- Successfully implemented and integrated the Scraper, Data Utils, Planner, and Enhancer modules
- Achieved stable code generation capabilities
- Developed a functioning execution pipeline via Jupyter server integration

## 6. Challenges and Future Work

- Complete development and integration of the Replanner module
- Enhance the adaptability of the Code Generation Agent to a wider range of Kaggle challenges
- Improve overall system performance and efficiency
- Conduct comprehensive testing across various challenge types

## 7. Conclusion

The Kaggle Agent project has made significant strides in automating the process of solving data science challenges. With key modules operational and producing stable results, we are well-positioned to continue development and refinement. next steps focus on completing the Replanner module and enhancing overall system performance to tackle an even broader range of Kaggle challenges effectively.
