## Data Description

**Personal records for about two-thirds (~8700) of the passengers, to be used as training data.**

- PassengerId - A unique Id for each passenger. Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and pp is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.
- HomePlanet - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.
- CryoSleep - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.
- Cabin - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard.
- Destination - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.
- Age - The age of the passenger.
- VIP - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.
- RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.
- Name - The first and last names of the passenger.
- Transported - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict.

## Problem Description

The Spaceship Titanic, carrying nearly 13,000 emigrants to three new exoplanets, collided with a spacetime anomaly near Alpha Centauri during its maiden voyage. As a result, almost half the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension. Your task is to predict which passengers were affected using data recovered from the ship's damaged systems to assist rescue efforts.
