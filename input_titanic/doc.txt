# spaceship-titanic
## problem description:
The Spaceship Titanic, carrying nearly 13,000 emigrants to three new exoplanets, collided with a spacetime anomaly near Alpha Centauri during its maiden voyage. As a result, almost half the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension. Your task is to predict which passengers were affected using data recovered from the ship's damaged systems to assist rescue efforts.
target column is : "Transported"

Data set Info

### quantitative_analysis
The dataset consists of 8693 rows and 14 columns. The numerical columns include Age, RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, and VRDeck. The Age column has a mean of approximately 28.83 years, with a standard deviation of 14.49, indicating a relatively young passenger demographic. The maximum values for RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, and VRDeck show significant outliers, particularly in RoomService (max: 14327) and FoodCourt (max: 29813), which may skew the analysis. The target variable, Transported, is binary, indicating whether a passenger was transported or not. The distribution of the target variable should be examined for class imbalance, which could affect model performance. Missing values are present in several columns, with CryoSleep, Cabin, Destination, Age, VIP, and various spending categories having significant amounts of missing data, which could impact the analysis and model training if not handled properly.

### qualitative_analysis
The dataset contains several categorical variables: HomePlanet, CryoSleep, Cabin, Destination, and VIP. HomePlanet has 3 unique values, while Destination also has 3 unique values, indicating a limited range of options. CryoSleep and VIP are binary features. The Cabin variable has a high cardinality with 6560 unique entries, which may complicate analysis. Missing data is prevalent across multiple columns, particularly in HomePlanet (201 missing), CryoSleep (217 missing), and VIP (203 missing). The missing data could be due to incomplete records from the damaged computer system. The relationships between features and the target variable should be explored, particularly how spending in RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, and VRDeck correlates with the likelihood of being transported. Additionally, the impact of Age, HomePlanet, and CryoSleep on the target variable should be analyzed to identify potential predictors.
