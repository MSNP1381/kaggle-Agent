The columns are as follows:\\n\\n1. **Home**: An integer identifier for each home (int64).\\n2. **Price**: The price of the home (int64).\\n3. **SqFt**: The square footage of the home (int64).\\n4. **Bedrooms**: The number of bedrooms in the home (int64).\\n5. **Bathrooms**: The number of bathrooms in the home (int64).\\n6. **Offers**: The number of offers received for the home (int64).\\n7. **Brick**: A categorical variable indicating whether the home is made of brick (object).\\n8. **Neighborhood**: A categorical variable representing the neighborhood in which the home is located (object).\\n\\n#### Data Types\\n- **Numerical Features**: Home, Price, SqFt, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Offers (all int64).\\n- **Categorical Features**: Brick, Neighborhood (both object).\\n\\n#### Missing Values\\n- There are no missing values in any of the columns, which is a positive aspect of the dataset.\\n\\n#### Unique Values\\n- **Home**: 128 unique values (each home is unique).\\n- **Price**: 123 unique values, indicating some homes may share the same price.\\n- **SqFt**: 61 unique values, suggesting a variety of home sizes.\\n- **Bedrooms**: 4 unique values (likely 1 to 4 bedrooms).\\n- **Bathrooms**: 3 unique values (likely 1 to 3 bathrooms).\\n- **Offers**: 6 unique values, indicating the number of offers can vary.\\n- **Brick**: 2 unique values (likely indicating 'Yes' or 'No').\\n- **Neighborhood**: 3 unique values, indicating a limited number of neighborhoods.\\n\\n#### Potential Issues\\n- The categorical variables (Brick and Neighborhood) need to be encoded for machine learning algorithms.\\n- The numerical features should be examined for outliers, especially Price and SqFt, as they can significantly affect model performance.\\n- The dataset is relatively small (128 samples), which may limit the complexity of the models that can be effectively trained.\\n\\n### Recommended Preprocessing Steps\\n\\n1. **Encoding Categorical Variables**:\\n   - Use **Label Encoding** for the 'Brick' column since it has only two unique values.\\n   - Use **One-Hot Encoding** for the 'Neighborhood' column to create binary columns for each neighborhood.\\n\\n2. **Feature Scaling**:\\n   - Apply **Standardization** (Z-score normalization) or **Min-Max Scaling** to the numerical features (Price, SqFt, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Offers) to ensure they are on a similar scale, which can improve the performance of many machine learning algorithms.\\n\\n3. **Outlier Detection**:\\n   - Analyze the numerical features for outliers using methods such as the IQR (Interquartile Range) method or Z-scores. Consider removing or transforming outliers if they are deemed to significantly skew the data.\\n\\n4. **Feature Engineering**:\\n   - Consider creating new features that may be useful for prediction, such as:\\n     - Price per square foot (Price/SqFt).\\n     - Total number of rooms (Bedrooms + Bathrooms).\\n     - A binary feature indicating whether the home has more than a certain number of offers.\\n\\n5. **Train-Test Split**:\\n   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split) to evaluate model performance.\\n\\n6. **Model Selection**:\\n   - Given the small size of the dataset, consider using simpler models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees) before moving to more complex models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).\\n\\n7. **Cross-Validation**:\\n   - Use k-fold cross-validation to ensure that the model's performance is robust and not overly fitted to the training data.\\n\\n8. **Data Visualization**:\\n   - Visualize the relationships between features and the target variable (Price) using scatter plots, box plots, and correlation matrices to gain insights into the data.\\n\",\n \"preprocessing_steps\": [\n  \"By following these preprocessing steps, the dataset will be better prepared for machine learning tasks, potentially leading to improved model performance and more accurate predictions.\"\n ]\n}","current_task":"Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split) to prepare for model training and evaluation.","model_info":null,"planned_tasks":["Select appropriate machine learning models for training, starting with simpler models like Linear Regression and Decision Trees, and consider more complex models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting if necessary.","Train the selected models on the training dataset, tuning hyperparameters as needed to optimize performance.","Evaluate the models using k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness and avoid overfitting.","Calculate the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for each model on the test dataset to assess performance.","Compare the RMSE scores of different models to identify the best-performing model.","Document the findings, including model performance, feature importance, and any insights gained from the analysis."],"evaluation_metric":null,"best_score":null},"task_code_pairs":"\n*************\ntask No.1\n\nTask:\n\nLoad the dataset from './house_prices.csv' using pandas and inspect the first few rows to understand its structure.\n\n---------------------\n\nCode :\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('./house_prices.csv')\n\n# Inspect the first few rows of the dataset\ndisplay(df.head())\n\n# Output the data types of each column\ndata_types = df.dtypes\nprint(data_types)\n\n# Output the shape of the dataset\nshape = df.shape\nprint(shape)\n\n---------------------\n\nResult:\n\n\n   Home   Price  SqFt  Bedrooms  Bathrooms  Offers Brick Neighborhood\n0     1  114300  1790         2          2       2    No         East\n1     2  114200  2030         4          2       3    No         East\n2     3  114800  1740         3          2       1    No         East\n3     4   94700  1980         3          2       3    No         East\n4     5  119800  2130         3          3       3    No         East\n\n\n*************\n\n\n*************\ntask No.2\n\nTask:\n\nCheck the data types of each column to ensure they are appropriate for analysis.\n\n---------------------\n\nCode :\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('./house_prices.csv')\n\ndata_types = df.dtypes\nshape = df.shape\n\n# Output the data types of each column\nprint('Data Types of Each Column:\\n', data_types)\n\n# Output the shape of the dataset\nprint('Shape of the Dataset:', shape)\n\n---------------------\n\nResult:\n\n\nData Types of Each Column:\n Home             int64\nPrice            int64\nSqFt             int64\nBedrooms         int64\nBathrooms        int64\nOffers           int64\nBrick           object\nNeighborhood    object\ndtype: object\nShape of the Dataset: (128, 8)\n\n\n\n*************\n\n\n*************\ntask No.3\n\nTask:\n\nPerform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize the distribution of the target variable (Price) and the relationships between features.\n\n---------------------\n\nCode :\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\n# Load the dataset\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('./house_prices.csv')\n\n# Set the aesthetic style of the plots\nsns.set(style='whitegrid')\n\n# 1.

The columns are as follows:\\n\\n1. **Home**: An integer identifier for each home (int64).\\n2. **Price**: The price of the home (int64).\\n3. **SqFt**: The square footage of the home (int64).\\n4. **Bedrooms**: The number of bedrooms in the home (int64).\\n5. **Bathrooms**: The number of bathrooms in the home (int64).\\n6. **Offers**: The number of offers received for the home (int64).\\n7. **Brick**: A categorical variable indicating whether the home is made of brick (object).\\n8. **Neighborhood**: A categorical variable representing the neighborhood in which the home is located (object).\\n\\n#### Data Types\\n- **Numerical Features**: Home, Price, SqFt, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Offers (all int64).\\n- **Categorical Features**: Brick, Neighborhood (both object).\\n\\n#### Missing Values\\n- There are no missing values in any of the columns, which is a positive aspect of the dataset.\\n\\n#### Unique Values\\n- **Home**: 128 unique values (each home is unique).\\n- **Price**: 123 unique values, indicating some homes may share the same price.\\n- **SqFt**: 61 unique values, suggesting a variety of home sizes.\\n- **Bedrooms**: 4 unique values (likely 1 to 4 bedrooms).\\n- **Bathrooms**: 3 unique values (likely 1 to 3 bathrooms).\\n- **Offers**: 6 unique values, indicating the number of offers can vary.\\n- **Brick**: 2 unique values (likely indicating 'Yes' or 'No').\\n- **Neighborhood**: 3 unique values, indicating a limited number of neighborhoods.\\n\\n#### Potential Issues\\n- The categorical variables (Brick and Neighborhood) need to be encoded for machine learning algorithms.\\n- The numerical features should be examined for outliers, especially Price and SqFt, as they can significantly affect model performance.\\n- The dataset is relatively small (128 samples), which may limit the complexity of the models that can be effectively trained.\\n\\n### Recommended Preprocessing Steps\\n\\n1. **Encoding Categorical Variables**:\\n   - Use **Label Encoding** for the 'Brick' column since it has only two unique values.\\n   - Use **One-Hot Encoding** for the 'Neighborhood' column to create binary columns for each neighborhood.\\n\\n2. **Feature Scaling**:\\n   - Apply **Standardization** (Z-score normalization) or **Min-Max Scaling** to the numerical features (Price, SqFt, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Offers) to ensure they are on a similar scale, which can improve the performance of many machine learning algorithms.\\n\\n3. **Outlier Detection**:\\n   - Analyze the numerical features for outliers using methods such as the IQR (Interquartile Range) method or Z-scores. Consider removing or transforming outliers if they are deemed to significantly skew the data.\\n\\n4. **Feature Engineering**:\\n   - Consider creating new features that may be useful for prediction, such as:\\n     - Price per square foot (Price/SqFt).\\n     - Total number of rooms (Bedrooms + Bathrooms).\\n     - A binary feature indicating whether the home has more than a certain number of offers.\\n\\n5. **Train-Test Split**:\\n   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split) to evaluate model performance.\\n\\n6. **Model Selection**:\\n   - Given the small size of the dataset, consider using simpler models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees) before moving to more complex models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).\\n\\n7. **Cross-Validation**:\\n   - Use k-fold cross-validation to ensure that the model's performance is robust and not overly fitted to the training data.\\n\\n8. **Data Visualization**:\\n   - Visualize the relationships between features and the target variable (Price) using scatter plots, box plots, and correlation matrices to gain insights into the data.\\n\",\n \"preprocessing_steps\": [\n  \"By following these preprocessing steps, the dataset will be better prepared for machine learning tasks, potentially leading to improved model performance and more accurate predictions.\"\n ]\n}","current_task":"Select appropriate machine learning models for training, starting with simpler models like Linear Regression and Decision Trees, and consider more complex models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting if necessary.","model_info":null,"planned_tasks":["Train the selected models on the training dataset, tuning hyperparameters as needed to optimize performance.","Evaluate the models using k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness and avoid overfitting.","Calculate the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for each model on the test dataset to assess performance.","Compare the RMSE scores of different models to identify the best-performing model.","Document the findings, including model performance, feature importance, and any insights gained from the analysis."],"evaluation_metric":null,"best_score":null},"task_code_pairs":"\n*************\ntask No.1\n\nTask:\n\nLoad the dataset from './house_prices.csv' using pandas and inspect the first few rows to understand its structure.\n\n---------------------\n\nCode :\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('./house_prices.csv')\n\n# Inspect the first few rows of the dataset\ndisplay(df.head())\n\n# Output the data types of each column\ndata_types = df.dtypes\nprint(data_types)\n\n# Output the shape of the dataset\nshape = df.shape\nprint(shape)\n\n---------------------\n\nResult:\n\n\n   Home   Price  SqFt  Bedrooms  Bathrooms  Offers Brick Neighborhood\n0     1  114300  1790         2          2       2    No         East\n1     2  114200  2030         4          2       3    No         East\n2     3  114800  1740         3          2       1    No         East\n3     4   94700  1980         3          2       3    No         East\n4     5  119800  2130         3          3       3    No         East\n\n\n*************\n\n\n*************\ntask No.2\n\nTask:\n\nCheck the data types of each column to ensure they are appropriate for analysis.\n\n---------------------\n\nCode :\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('./house_prices.csv')\n\ndata_types = df.dtypes\nshape = df.shape\n\n# Output the data types of each column\nprint('Data Types of Each Column:\\n', data_types)\n\n# Output the shape of the dataset\nprint('Shape of the Dataset:', shape)\n\n---------------------\n\nResult:\n\n\nData Types of Each Column:\n Home             int64\nPrice            int64\nSqFt             int64\nBedrooms         int64\nBathrooms        int64\nOffers           int64\nBrick           object\nNeighborhood    object\ndtype: object\nShape of the Dataset: (128, 8)\n\n\n\n*************\n\n\n*************\ntask No.3\n\nTask:\n\nPerform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize the distribution of the target variable (Price) and the relationships between features.\n\n---------------------\n\nCode :\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\n# Load the dataset\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('./house_prices.csv')\n\n# Set the aesthetic style of the plots\nsns.set(style='whitegrid')\n\n# 1.

This will create binary columns for each category.\\n\\n2. **Feature Scaling**:\\n   - Apply **Standardization** (Z-score normalization) or **Min-Max Scaling** to the numerical features ('Price', 'SqFt', 'Bedrooms', 'Bathrooms', 'Offers') to ensure they are on a similar scale. This is particularly important for algorithms that rely on distance metrics.\\n\\n3. **Outlier Detection**:\\n   - Analyze the distribution of the 'Price' and 'SqFt' columns to identify potential outliers. Consider using methods such as the IQR (Interquartile Range) method or Z-score analysis to detect and handle outliers appropriately (e.g., capping, removal).\\n\\n4. **Feature Engineering**:\\n   - Consider creating new features that may enhance model performance, such as:\\n     - A feature representing the ratio of bedrooms to bathrooms.\\n     - A feature representing the price per square foot (Price/SqFt).\\n\\n5. **Train-Test Split**:\\n   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split) to evaluate model performance on unseen data.\\n\\n6. **Data Visualization**:\\n   - Visualize the distributions of numerical features and the relationships between features (e.g., scatter plots, box plots) to gain insights into the data and inform further preprocessing steps.\\n\\n7. **Model Selection**:\\n   - After preprocessing, consider various machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests) and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, R\\u00b2) on the test set.\\n\",\n \"preprocessing_steps\": [\n  \"By following these preprocessing steps, the dataset will be better prepared for machine learning tasks, leading to improved model performance and more reliable predictions.\"\n ]\n}","model_info":null,"planned_tasks":["Visualize the relationships between features and the target variable 'Price' using scatter plots and box plots to gain insights into the data.","Select a variety of machine learning models to evaluate, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.","Train the selected models on the training dataset, tuning hyperparameters as necessary to optimize performance.","Evaluate the models on the test dataset using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric to determine their performance.","Compare the RMSE scores of the different models and select the best-performing model for final predictions.","Document the findings, including the model selection process, feature importance, and any insights gained from the analysis."],"evaluation_metric":null,"best_score":null}},"error":"no","enhanced_task":{"task":"Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split) to evaluate model performance on unseen data.","enhanced_description":"To prepare for model training and evaluation, split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets using an 80/20 ratio.

This will create binary columns for each category.\\n\\n2. **Feature Scaling**:\\n   - Apply **Standardization** (Z-score normalization) or **Min-Max Scaling** to the numerical features ('Price', 'SqFt', 'Bedrooms', 'Bathrooms', 'Offers') to ensure they are on a similar scale. This is particularly important for algorithms that rely on distance metrics.\\n\\n3. **Outlier Detection**:\\n   - Analyze the distribution of the 'Price' and 'SqFt' columns to identify potential outliers. Consider using methods such as the IQR (Interquartile Range) method or Z-score analysis to detect and handle outliers appropriately (e.g., capping, removal).\\n\\n4. **Feature Engineering**:\\n   - Consider creating new features that may enhance model performance, such as:\\n     - A feature representing the ratio of bedrooms to bathrooms.\\n     - A feature representing the price per square foot (Price/SqFt).\\n\\n5. **Train-Test Split**:\\n   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split) to evaluate model performance on unseen data.\\n\\n6. **Data Visualization**:\\n   - Visualize the distributions of numerical features and the relationships between features (e.g., scatter plots, box plots) to gain insights into the data and inform further preprocessing steps.\\n\\n7. **Model Selection**:\\n   - After preprocessing, consider various machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests) and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, R\\u00b2) on the test set.\\n\",\n \"preprocessing_steps\": [\n  \"By following these preprocessing steps, the dataset will be better prepared for machine learning tasks, leading to improved model performance and more reliable predictions.\"\n ]\n}","model_info":null,"planned_tasks":["Select a variety of machine learning models to evaluate, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.","Train the selected models on the training dataset, tuning hyperparameters as necessary to optimize performance.","Evaluate the models on the test dataset using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric to determine their performance.","Compare the RMSE scores of the different models and select the best-performing model for final predictions.","Document the findings, including the model selection process, feature importance, and any insights gained from the analysis."],"evaluation_metric":null,"best_score":null}},"error":"no","enhanced_task":{"task":"Visualize the relationships between features and the target variable 'Price' using scatter plots and box plots to gain insights into the data.","enhanced_description":"In this task, we will create visualizations to explore the relationships between the target variable 'Price' and the various features in the dataset.

This will create binary columns for each category.\\n\\n2. **Feature Scaling**:\\n   - Apply **Standardization** (Z-score normalization) or **Min-Max Scaling** to the numerical features ('Price', 'SqFt', 'Bedrooms', 'Bathrooms', 'Offers') to ensure they are on a similar scale. This is particularly important for algorithms that rely on distance metrics.\\n\\n3. **Outlier Detection**:\\n   - Analyze the distribution of the 'Price' and 'SqFt' columns to identify potential outliers. Consider using methods such as the IQR (Interquartile Range) method or Z-score analysis to detect and handle outliers appropriately (e.g., capping, removal).\\n\\n4. **Feature Engineering**:\\n   - Consider creating new features that may enhance model performance, such as:\\n     - A feature representing the ratio of bedrooms to bathrooms.\\n     - A feature representing the price per square foot (Price/SqFt).\\n\\n5. **Train-Test Split**:\\n   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split) to evaluate model performance on unseen data.\\n\\n6. **Data Visualization**:\\n   - Visualize the distributions of numerical features and the relationships between features (e.g., scatter plots, box plots) to gain insights into the data and inform further preprocessing steps.\\n\\n7. **Model Selection**:\\n   - After preprocessing, consider various machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests) and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, R\\u00b2) on the test set.\\n\",\n \"preprocessing_steps\": [\n  \"By following these preprocessing steps, the dataset will be better prepared for machine learning tasks, leading to improved model performance and more reliable predictions.\"\n ]\n}","model_info":null,"planned_tasks":["Train the selected models on the training dataset, tuning hyperparameters as necessary to optimize performance.","Evaluate the models on the test dataset using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric to determine their performance.","Compare the RMSE scores of the different models and select the best-performing model for final predictions.","Document the findings, including the model selection process, feature importance, and any insights gained from the analysis."],"evaluation_metric":null,"best_score":null}},"error":"no","enhanced_task":{"task":"Select a variety of machine learning models to evaluate, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.","enhanced_description":"In this task, you will select and implement a variety of machine learning models to evaluate their performance in predicting house prices based on the features in the dataset.

This will create binary columns for each category.\\n\\n2. **Feature Scaling**:\\n   - Apply **Standardization** (Z-score normalization) or **Min-Max Scaling** to the numerical features ('Price', 'SqFt', 'Bedrooms', 'Bathrooms', 'Offers') to ensure they are on a similar scale. This is particularly important for algorithms that rely on distance metrics.\\n\\n3. **Outlier Detection**:\\n   - Analyze the distribution of the 'Price' and 'SqFt' columns to identify potential outliers. Consider using methods such as the IQR (Interquartile Range) method or Z-score analysis to detect and handle outliers appropriately (e.g., capping, removal).\\n\\n4. **Feature Engineering**:\\n   - Consider creating new features that may enhance model performance, such as:\\n     - A feature representing the ratio of bedrooms to bathrooms.\\n     - A feature representing the price per square foot (Price/SqFt).\\n\\n5. **Train-Test Split**:\\n   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split) to evaluate model performance on unseen data.\\n\\n6. **Data Visualization**:\\n   - Visualize the distributions of numerical features and the relationships between features (e.g., scatter plots, box plots) to gain insights into the data and inform further preprocessing steps.\\n\\n7. **Model Selection**:\\n   - After preprocessing, consider various machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests) and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, R\\u00b2) on the test set.\\n\",\n \"preprocessing_steps\": [\n  \"By following these preprocessing steps, the dataset will be better prepared for machine learning tasks, leading to improved model performance and more reliable predictions.\"\n ]\n}","model_info":null,"planned_tasks":["Evaluate the models on the test dataset using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric to determine their performance.","Compare the RMSE scores of the different models and select the best-performing model for final predictions.","Document the findings, including the model selection process, feature importance, and any insights gained from the analysis."],"evaluation_metric":null,"best_score":null}},"error":"no","enhanced_task":{"task":"Train the selected models on the training dataset, tuning hyperparameters as necessary to optimize performance.","enhanced_description":"In this task, you will train a variety of machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, on the training dataset.

The columns are as follows:\\n\\n1. **Home**: An integer identifier for each home (int64).\\n2. **Price**: The price of the home (int64).\\n3. **SqFt**: The square footage of the home (int64).\\n4. **Bedrooms**: The number of bedrooms in the home (int64).\\n5. **Bathrooms**: The number of bathrooms in the home (int64).\\n6. **Offers**: The number of offers received for the home (int64).\\n7. **Brick**: A categorical variable indicating whether the home is made of brick (object).\\n8. **Neighborhood**: A categorical variable representing the neighborhood in which the home is located (object).\\n\\n#### Data Types\\n- **Numerical Features**: Home, Price, SqFt, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Offers (all int64).\\n- **Categorical Features**: Brick, Neighborhood (both object).\\n\\n#### Missing Values\\nThe dataset has no missing values across all columns, which is a positive aspect as it simplifies the preprocessing steps.\\n\\n#### Unique Values\\n- **Home**: 128 unique values (each home is unique).\\n- **Price**: 123 unique values, indicating some homes may share the same price.\\n- **SqFt**: 61 unique values, suggesting a variety of home sizes.\\n- **Bedrooms**: 4 unique values (likely 1 to 4 bedrooms).\\n- **Bathrooms**: 3 unique values (likely 1 to 3 bathrooms).\\n- **Offers**: 6 unique values, indicating the number of offers can vary.\\n- **Brick**: 2 unique values (likely indicating 'Yes' or 'No').\\n- **Neighborhood**: 3 unique values, indicating a limited number of neighborhoods.\\n\\n#### Potential Issues\\n- **Categorical Variables**: The 'Brick' and 'Neighborhood' columns are categorical and will need to be encoded for machine learning algorithms.\\n- **Price Distribution**: The unique values in 'Price' suggest that there may be outliers or a non-normal distribution that could affect model performance.\\n- **Feature Scaling**: Numerical features may require scaling, especially if using algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes (e.g., KNN, SVM).\\n\\n### Recommended Preprocessing Steps\\n\\n1. **Encoding Categorical Variables**:\\n   - Use **One-Hot Encoding** for the 'Brick' and 'Neighborhood' columns to convert them into numerical format. This will create binary columns for each category.\\n\\n2. **Feature Scaling**:\\n   - Apply **Standardization** (Z-score normalization) or **Min-Max Scaling** to the numerical features ('Price', 'SqFt', 'Bedrooms', 'Bathrooms', 'Offers') to ensure they are on a similar scale. This is particularly important for algorithms that rely on distance metrics.\\n\\n3. **Outlier Detection**:\\n   - Analyze the distribution of the 'Price' and 'SqFt' columns to identify potential outliers. Consider using methods such as the IQR (Interquartile Range) method or Z-score analysis to detect and handle outliers appropriately (e.g., capping, removal).\\n\\n4. **Feature Engineering**:\\n   - Consider creating new features that may enhance model performance, such as:\\n     - A feature representing the ratio of bedrooms to bathrooms.\\n     - A feature representing the price per square foot (Price/SqFt).\\n\\n5. **Train-Test Split**:\\n   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split) to evaluate model performance on unseen data.\\n\\n6. **Data Visualization**:\\n   - Visualize the distributions of numerical features and the relationships between features (e.g., scatter plots, box plots) to gain insights into the data and inform further preprocessing steps.\\n\\n7. **Model Selection**:\\n   - After preprocessing, consider various machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests) and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, R\\u00b2) on the test set.\\n\",\n \"preprocessing_steps\": [\n  \"By following these preprocessing steps, the dataset will be better prepared for machine learning tasks, leading to improved model performance and more reliable predictions.\"\n ]\n}","model_info":null,"planned_tasks":["Compare the RMSE scores of the different models and select the best-performing model for final predictions.","Document the findings, including the model selection process, feature importance, and any insights gained from the analysis."],"evaluation_metric":null,"best_score":null}},"error":"no","enhanced_task":{"task":"Evaluate the models on the test dataset using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric to determine their performance.","enhanced_description":"In this task, we will evaluate the performance of the trained machine learning models on the test dataset using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric.

This will create binary columns for each category.\\n\\n2. **Feature Scaling**:\\n   - Apply **Standardization** (Z-score normalization) or **Min-Max Scaling** to the numerical features ('Price', 'SqFt', 'Bedrooms', 'Bathrooms', 'Offers') to ensure they are on a similar scale. This is particularly important for algorithms that rely on distance metrics.\\n\\n3. **Outlier Detection**:\\n   - Analyze the distribution of the 'Price' and 'SqFt' columns to identify potential outliers. Consider using methods such as the IQR (Interquartile Range) method or Z-score analysis to detect and handle outliers appropriately (e.g., capping, removal).\\n\\n4. **Feature Engineering**:\\n   - Consider creating new features that may enhance model performance, such as:\\n     - A feature representing the ratio of bedrooms to bathrooms.\\n     - A feature representing the price per square foot (Price/SqFt).\\n\\n5. **Train-Test Split**:\\n   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split) to evaluate model performance on unseen data.\\n\\n6. **Data Visualization**:\\n   - Visualize the distributions of numerical features and the relationships between features (e.g., scatter plots, box plots) to gain insights into the data and inform further preprocessing steps.\\n\\n7. **Model Selection**:\\n   - After preprocessing, consider various machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests) and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, R\\u00b2) on the test set.\\n\",\n \"preprocessing_steps\": [\n  \"By following these preprocessing steps, the dataset will be better prepared for machine learning tasks, leading to improved model performance and more reliable predictions.\"\n ]\n}","model_info":null,"planned_tasks":["Document the findings, including the model selection process, feature importance, and any insights gained from the analysis."],"evaluation_metric":null,"best_score":null}},"error":"no","enhanced_task":{"task":"Compare the RMSE scores of the different models and select the best-performing model for final predictions.","enhanced_description":"In this task, we will compare the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) scores of various machine learning models that have been trained on the house prices dataset.

This will create binary columns for each category.\\n\\n2. **Feature Scaling**:\\n   - Apply **Standardization** (Z-score normalization) or **Min-Max Scaling** to the numerical features ('Price', 'SqFt', 'Bedrooms', 'Bathrooms', 'Offers') to ensure they are on a similar scale. This is particularly important for algorithms that rely on distance metrics.\\n\\n3. **Outlier Detection**:\\n   - Analyze the distribution of the 'Price' and 'SqFt' columns to identify potential outliers. Consider using methods such as the IQR (Interquartile Range) method or Z-score analysis to detect and handle outliers appropriately (e.g., capping, removal).\\n\\n4. **Feature Engineering**:\\n   - Consider creating new features that may enhance model performance, such as:\\n     - A feature representing the ratio of bedrooms to bathrooms.\\n     - A feature representing the price per square foot (Price/SqFt).\\n\\n5. **Train-Test Split**:\\n   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split) to evaluate model performance on unseen data.\\n\\n6. **Data Visualization**:\\n   - Visualize the distributions of numerical features and the relationships between features (e.g., scatter plots, box plots) to gain insights into the data and inform further preprocessing steps.\\n\\n7. **Model Selection**:\\n   - After preprocessing, consider various machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests) and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, R\\u00b2) on the test set.\\n\",\n \"preprocessing_steps\": [\n  \"By following these preprocessing steps, the dataset will be better prepared for machine learning tasks, leading to improved model performance and more reliable predictions.\"\n ]\n}","model_info":null,"planned_tasks":[],"evaluation_metric":null,"best_score":null}},"error":"no","enhanced_task":{"task":"Document the findings, including the model selection process, feature importance, and any insights gained from the analysis.","enhanced_description":"The goal of this task is to comprehensively document the findings from the house price prediction project.
