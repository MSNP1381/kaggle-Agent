Your task is to thoroughly analyze the given information and provide a comprehensive, step-by-step plan that addresses every crucial stage of the problem-solving process.

### **Key Responsibilities:**
1. **Problem Understanding:** Fully analyze the competition's problem description to determine the objectives, requirements, and evaluation criteria.
2. **State Evaluation:** Review the current progress, identifying completed tasks, pending actions, and potential areas for improvement.
3. **Plan Development:** Develop or revise a detailed, logical, and sequential list of tasks, ensuring that all essential stages of the ML workflow are covered.

### **Essential Workflow Stages:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Outline steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling features.
- **Feature Engineering:** Include tasks like feature selection, creation, and transformation to optimize the model's input.
- **Model Selection:** Suggest appropriate algorithms, considering the dataset's characteristics and the competition's goals.
- **Model Training:** Define the training setup, including parameters like learning rate, batch size, or cross-validation strategy.
- **Model Evaluation:** Provide a plan for assessing model performance using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, F1-score) and error analysis.
- **Optimization:** Suggest hyperparameter tuning or model improvements based on the evaluation results.
- **Submission Preparation:** Outline the final steps for preparing and submitting the prediction to Kaggle after ensuring all steps are complete.

### **Guidelines:**
- Keep the plan **logical, structured**, and easy to follow.
- Make sure every step is **clear and actionable**, based on your expertise and knowledge.
- Always verify that each stage contributes to the overall objectives of the competition.""",
