  "** Data Preprocessing **\n1. Handle missing values in 'keyword' and 'location' columns by filling them with a placeholder or using imputation techniques.\n2. Encode categorical data: Use one-hot encoding for 'keyword' and 'location' columns, considering their high cardinality.\n3. Scale features: Not applicable for text data, but ensure numerical stability if any numerical features are added later.\n4. Address class imbalance in 'target' using techniques like SMOTE or adjusting class weights during model training.\n5. Data augmentation: Not applicable for text data, but consider using NLP-specific augmentation techniques like synonym replacement.\n6. Handle outliers and anomalies: Not applicable for binary 'target', but ensure text preprocessing handles noise.\n7. Data splitting: Use stratified train-test split to maintain class distribution, and apply cross-validation for robust evaluation.",
  "** Feature Engineering **\n1. Feature extraction from 'text': Use TF-IDF vectorization or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) to convert text into numerical format.\n2. Leverage pre-trained language models like BERT or RoBERTa for feature extraction to capture contextual information.\n3. Create new features: Analyze 'keyword' and 'location' for patterns and create binary features indicating presence of certain keywords or locations.\n4. Dimensionality reduction: Use techniques like PCA if necessary, but prioritize feature selection based on model interpretability.\n5. Encode categorical variables: Use target encoding for 'keyword' and 'location' if one-hot encoding is too sparse.\n6. Feature scaling: Normalize text features if using embeddings to ensure consistent input to models.",
  "** Model Selection **\n1. Choose algorithms suitable for text classification: Consider logistic regression, support vector machines, or ensemble methods like Random Forest.\n2. Explore deep learning models: Use LSTM or transformers for capturing sequential information in text.\n3. Baseline models: Start with simple models like logistic regression to establish a performance benchmark.\n4. Consider pre-trained models: Fine-tune BERT or similar models for potentially higher accuracy.",
  "** Model Training **\n1. Define training setup: Use learning rate schedules, batch size tuning, and early stopping to optimize training.\n2. Cross-validation strategy: Implement k-fold cross-validation to ensure model robustness.\n3. Handle overfitting: Use techniques like dropout, L2 regularization, and data augmentation to prevent overfitting.",
  "** Model Evaluation **\n1. Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.\n2. Perform error analysis to identify common misclassifications and refine model features or architecture.\n3. Use validation and test sets to evaluate generalization performance and avoid data leakage.",
  "** Optimization **\n1. Hyperparameter tuning: Use grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to find optimal model parameters.\n2. Model improvements: Iterate on feature engineering and model architecture based on evaluation insights.",
  "** Submission Preparation **\n1. Prepare final predictions on the test set, ensuring all preprocessing and feature engineering steps are applied consistently.\n2. Post-processing: Apply any necessary threshold adjustments or ensemble methods to improve final predictions.\n3. Submit predictions to Kaggle, ensuring compliance with competition rules and format."
